The Weather Forecast Web App is a full-stack application designed to provide real-time weather data while integrating statistical forecasting models for predictive analysis. 
It pulls data from external weather APIs and presents it in an interactive, user-friendly interface, making it informative and engaging for users.
🎯 Key Objectives:
* Retrieve accurate weather data dynamically based on location
* Predict rainfall trends using linear regression modeling
* Display interactive weather graphs with Chart.js
* Ensure backend efficiency by optimizing API calls
* Maintain secure credentials using environment variables

 Tech Stack & Architecture
🔹 Backend (Spring Boot & Java)
* Handles API requests and communicates with external weather APIs
* Implements database storage (using MySQL) to prevent redundant API calls
* Performs statistical modeling for predictive rainfall analysis
* Manages environment variables for secure API authentication
🔹 Frontend (Angular & Tailwind CSS)
* Provides dynamic UI with real-time weather updates
* Visualizes trends using Chart.js for temperature and rainfall insights
* Optimizes user experience with responsive design
* Communicates with the backend via secure API calls

-- How the Weather App Works
1️) User Interaction
The user enters a city name or allows geolocation-based weather retrieval.
2️) Backend API Calls
*The Spring Boot backend makes efficient requests to the weather API, ensuring:
*Only necessary data is fetched (reducing redundant calls)
3️) Statistical Prediction
*The backend applies linear regression models to historical data, calculating:
*Projected temperature trends
*Estimated rainfall probability
4️) Frontend Rendering
* The Angular frontend takes the processed data and:
* Generates dynamic weather charts using Chart.js
* Displays results in an interactive UI
* Adapts the layout for mobile users (Tailwind CSS responsiveness)

⚙ Optimization Strategies
* Reduced Redundant API Calls → Optimized backend queries for efficiency
* Statistical Accuracy → Linear regression improves forecasting reliability
* Secure API Handling → Environment variables ensure safe authentication

🚀 Next Steps & Potential Enhancements
* Enable multi-location tracking for regional weather comparison
* Optimize frontend animations to enhance user experience
* Deploy the app online for public use via Azure, Vercel, or Render
* Make The Weather App more personalized by including JWT Authentication.
